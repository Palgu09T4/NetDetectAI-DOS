# NetDetectAI-DOS

**AI-Powered DoS Attack Detection System**

NetDetectAI-DoS is an end-to-end cybersecurity detection system designed to identify Denial of Service (DoS) attacks from network traffic data using machine learning. It includes a comparison of five ML algorithms and a deployed Django-based web application for interactive predictions.

How It Works

### Data Collection
- Network traffic is captured using **Wireshark** in `.csv` format.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Feature Engineering
- Extracted key flow features such as:
  - 'Flow Duration', 'Flow_Byts/s', 'Tot_Fwd_Pkts', 'Tot_Bwd_Pkts', 
    'Fwd_Pkt_Len_Max', 'Bwd_Pkt_Len_Max', 'Fwd_IAT_Mean', 'Bwd_IAT_Mean',
    'SYN_Flag_Cnt', 'RST_Flag_Cnt', 'ACK_Flag_Cnt', 'Flow_Pkts/s'
- Processed and cleaned using **Pandas** and **NumPy**.

---

### Model Training
- Trained and evaluated multiple machine learning classifiers:
  - ‚úÖ **Random Forest** (best performance)
  - Decision Tree  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - Neural Network  
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Utilized **Scikit-learn** for modeling and evaluation.

## üíª Web Application Features

Built using **Django** + **Chart.js** + **Bootstrap**:

- Upload a `.csv` file containing network traffic
- Visualize DoS vs Normal traffic 
- Prediction using Random Forest (best model)
- Download prediction results as CSV
- User Authentication: Sign up, Login, Password Reset
-  User history

### Deployment
- Deployed using **Render (Free Tier)** with full online functionality.

## Machine Learning Models Used

Five machine learning algorithms were trained and evaluated:

- ‚úÖ **Random Forest Classifier** (Best Performance)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Neural Network
- Long short Term memory(LSTM)

The comparison was based on:
- Accuracy (Train/Test)
- Classification report (Precision, Recall, F1)
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC AUC Curves
- Feature Importance

### üìä Result Summary

| Model                    | Accuracy (Test) | ROC AUC Score                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Random Forest**        | ‚úÖ Highest      | ‚úÖ Highest                    |
| Decision Tree Classifier | High            | Good                            |
| K-Nearest Neighbors      | Moderate        | Fair                            |
| Neural Network (MLP)     | Moderate‚ÄìHigh   | Fair‚ÄìGood (if tuned)            |
| Long Short Term Memory   | Variable        | Good (only if time-series data) |
